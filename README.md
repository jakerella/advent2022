# Advent of Code 2022

This is my solution(s) for the Advent of Code challenge, 2022!

This year I've done the challenge in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), which I have never coded in before. Fun!

To run this repo (and thus the code challenge solutions):

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. If you're in WSL (or just a vanilla linux install), install the build tools: `sudo apt install build-essential`
3. Clone this repo
4. Run (and compile) the code: `cargo run`
